Name: Penn Course Graphs
Members: Bach Tran & Nhat-Ha Pham

Description: Penn Course Graph is an application that visualizes the connection between different courses at Penn. Users can
filter by department, and can view the graph with the courses as nodes. The courses are connected if they are similar in content,
or if one course is another's prerequisite. Users can also search for a course or a topic that they are interested in (for 
instance, "machine learning" or "COGS 1001") in the search bar. The application will return 5 courses that match the user's 
query based on cosine similarity, and courses similar to each of these courses.

Categories:
- Document Search: We used jsoup to scrape Penn's course catalog, and cosine similarity (using gensim library in Python) to 
retrieve courses with a cosine similarity larger or equal to 0.3 to a certain course. Information retrieval is also utilized 
to return results to the search bar (return courses similar to a query).
- Graph and graph algorithm: With the information retrieved from above, we used JavaScript and its libraries to build a
web application that displays graph visualizations (prerequisite/similar edges connecting different courses). We also used a
modified BFS to highlight connection between the courses when the user hovers over a certain course.
