# Penn Course Graph

Description: Penn Course Graph is an application that visualizes the connection between different courses at Penn. Users can
filter by department, and can view the graph with the courses as nodes. The courses are connected if they are similar in content,
or if one course is another's prerequisite. Users can also search for a topic that they are interested in (for 
instance, "machine learning" or "healthcare market") in the search bar. The application will return 5 courses that match the user's 
query based on cosine similarity, and courses similar to each of these courses.
